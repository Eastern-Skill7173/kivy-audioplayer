# Contributing


Before anything, I'd like to thank you for contributing to this project. No matter how small or big of a contribution you make, you will have an effect on the growth of this project. Open-source only works because of people like you.

### What to do

Before getting your hands dirty, it is important to understand what exactly you want to contribute to.

If you have experienced a bug, incompatibilities, installation issues or documentation inaccuracies, you are more than welcome to [create a new issue](https://github.com/Eastern-Skill7173/kivy-audioplayer/issues/new), right here on github.com!

It doesn't just have to be fixing problems! Even if you don't have an issue, submitting your ideas and ways to improve the project is massively appreciated. The view and perspective you bring to as a user is unmatched!

### What NOT to do

If you are having a question about the usage or if something is unclear, you will get much better and faster results reaching out to sites such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or communities and subreddits like [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) or [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/)

Following these guidelines ensures the fastest possible outreach and the best solution for all. It also indicates that you respect the time of the development team, so we can get back to you as soon as possible!

### Taking contributions to the next level

If you feel like the issue is something that you can fix yourself, you can clone, create a new branch and start working on it! This will significantly improve the speed of the contribution!

In order to keep up with convention, try naming your branch something like this:

```
git clone 123-android-player-issue
```

Where the beginning number is the supposed issue number on github you are working on, and the rest describes the problem mentioned within the issue.

So all the steps boil down to:

```
# To cloned the repo do:
git clone https://github.com/Eastern-Skill7173/kivy-audioplayer
# To change into the project directory:
cd kivy-audioplayer/
# To create and switch to a new branch:
git checkout -b 123-android-player-issue
```


# Ground Rules

### Be respectful and embracing

Everyone who is present in the contribution scene must agree to our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Remember to keep an open mind and be welcoming of everyone. Be constructive but not hurtful. Embrace newcomers and be sure to guide them.

### Details are everything but so is modesty

When creating an issue, make sure to provide **RELEVANT** details as much as possible.

Details help narrow down where, why and how the issue has occurred.

Versions of python, kivy and the project itself are of great importance, so is the operating system the code is being run on. Providing the error code and location (the line in which the error occurred) is also mandatory.

If you are providing any other details, make sure that they truly have an effect on the problem at hand.

Giving a [minimal reproducible example (MRE)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) where the issue is repeated will highlight the issue and bring it to the center of attention paving the way for the community and developers to jump straight to action!


# NOT WRITTEN BEYOND THIS POINT

### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools they’ll need to contribute

>For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the jQuery Foundation.
    * Note the jQuery Foundation Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
### Explain security disclosures first!
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to security@travis-ci.org
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at security@travis-ci.org.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.

> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
>
> Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

[source: [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express#philosophy)] **Need more inspiration?** [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin#goals)

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the puppet-dev list. Notes are posted to the Puppet Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout.
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community
If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time.

> You can chat with the core team on https://gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber. We try to have office hours on Fridays.
